These files comes from the https://github.com/IOsetting/py32f0-template project.

This `PY32F0xx HAL` works for PY32F002A, PY32F003, and PY32F030 series of Puya
PY32 chips.

There is no actual `HAL` here as such, we just use the `hal` word in the conventional
sense.


Development note:

Please get rid of all the suspect code marked with the `Hack` keyword.
